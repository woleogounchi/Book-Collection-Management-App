# techdegree-project8
 

In this project, we are creating an application for our local library to help them manage their collection of books.
Long story short, the librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. He now wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.
So for the project, we'll build a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. 
We will use a provided HTML design as well as an existing SQLite database. The technologies that are to be implemented in the project are the following: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
